		"bio": "Hi there! I am Ozan! I've been coding for about 1 year now. As a Full Stack developer I've worked both with frontend and backend technologies and have worked out my favourites. Along the journey I realised my passion for coding is ðŸ”¥ and is not draining. With this passion, I have now created some nice to have projects. Through coding I became more self conscious and were able to organize more than just my daily code in life.",
